"My experience in using Slack is so far really good! I'm head of a board which has the role of maintaining our apartment building and its economy. We are five people in the board and use Slack to communicate things that happens on a daily basis, since we only meet up once per month.

We have set up channels for different topics related to our work, such as economy, bigger projects, disturbances, maintenance of different parts of the building etc. Since everything is searchable we can easily find old discussions and decisions if needed.

Before going to Slack we were only using email, which was clumsy and slow. Our communication is now more effective and can be divided into smaller chunks which are more easily digested than long emails. This is positive since our board assignments are done on our spare time with only a small symbolic payment.

I can see the use of Slack being a good tool in similar team setups, for instance at work, where I work with software development. However, the team must all be interested in trying it out and use it as their default contact option in order to get the value out of it." **Michael Persson** *System Test Engineer at Schneider Electric*
