## Idea

A lot of people struggle to be productive, because they're easily and often distracted by certain things. A lot of startups or an already stable company are looking up on ways to make sure they follow up with their developers and increase their level of productivity. I created this repository because I wanted to bring together tips and tools on the web on increasing the level of productivity, from blogs, developer stories, and experiences, for Solo and for teams. So do you have a tip or a tool that has helped you level-up your :muscle: productivity? Do feel very free to contribute them? Or you know or have seen a tool listed that you have used and it has done more than just increasing your :runner: productivity or your team's :two_men_holding_hands: :two_women_holding_hands: productivity? Feel free to update it's description or/and add positive experiences. :rocket: :rocket:

## Guidelines

**Contributing a new tool and tip**

1. Feel free to contribute - make your changes and submit a PR.
2. If adding a new tool, add them on the right table of contents, please follow an alphabetical order, so it'll help other people locate the resources easily.
3. Individual tools in the content do not have to be in alphabetical order.
4. Individual tool in the content, under the topic, is where the description or the tips should be.
5. You can detail the tips or description as much as possible.
6. Include the technological platform and link to your experience or if no experience, a way for others to add their experience about  the tool you contributed, 
4. When creating a new topic not tool/tip, please make sure to link the topic on the table of content to the topic on the content.
